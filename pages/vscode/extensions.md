title: Extensions

Here is a list of extensions I use in no particular order.  If there are no notes under the extension there is nothing that I configured, just used the defaults.  You may want to look at the settings for each plugin to see if there is something you would benefit from.

- [Docker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker)
- [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
- [WSL Integration](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl)
  - The first time you launch VSCode after installing WSL you will get a pop up asking to install the extension.  You can also manually install from the extension list
