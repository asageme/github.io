I figured a good first post would probably be how I set up this site.  It was quite a learning experience and took me way longer that I thought due to all the rabbit holes I ventured down that I probably should have avoided.

The resources for this guide are all in pages on this site.  [Here](/pages) is a sitemap for all my pages.

1. The first step is to get a new domain if you plan on using a custom domain
   - [Set up DNS](/pages/github/pages/set-up-dns)
2. Install WSL
   - [Install WSL](/pages/wsl/install)
3. Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
   - Accept all the defaults during install
      > Make sure you installed WSL so Docker Desktop can use it
      {: .prompt-tip }
4. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win) for Windows
   - Accept all the defaults during install
5. Install and set up VSCode
   - [Set up VSCode](/pages/vscode/initial-setup)
6. Set up Jekyll to use whatever theme you chose
   - [Set up Jekyll](/pages/github/pages/jekyll/set-up-jekyll)

Once you follow through the steps above you should have a shiny new web page on a custom domain waiting for you to add content.
